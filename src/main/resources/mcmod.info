  "description": "Terramap's concept is simple: minimap mod are very limited when it comes to Terra121, they do not have low zoom views, and requires the world to be visited, even though the generation is not random. Terramap fixes tat by adding a minimap and a full-screen map, but instead of rendering it from the actual Minecraft world save, it displays web maps of the actual world (OpenStreetMap, Mapbox satellite, and others). It also renders various elements on that maps: players, even when they are on the other side of the world, and entities, for now (server warps are planned). It also has various functionalities to better interact with the Terra world, such as teleporting, opening places on various websites, or copy geo, block, chunk or region coordinates. Outside of the map it also key-bindings to easily copy coordinates to the clip-board. The mod has extensive configuration options and permission nodes, making it server and even survival friendly.",
